                only when the IOMMU is disabled.
                The acceptable value is a string that starts with "0x"

Description:    Allow the root user to disable/enable in runtime the clock
                gating mechanism in Gaudi. Due to how Gaudi is built, the
                clock gating needs to be disabled in order to access the
                registers of the TPC and MME engines. This is sometimes needed
                during debug by the user and hence the user needs this option.
                The user can supply a bitmask value, each bit represents
                a different engine to disable/enable its clock gating feature.
                The bitmask is composed of 20 bits:
                0  -  7 : DMA channels
                8  - 11 : MME engines
                12 - 19 : TPC engines
                The bit's location of a specific engine can be determined
                using (1 << GAUDI_ENGINE_ID_*). GAUDI_ENGINE_ID_* values
                are defined in uapi habanalabs.h file in enum gaudi_engine_id

Description:    Allows the root user to read or write directly through the
                device's PCI bar. Writing to this file generates a write
                transaction while reading from the file generates a read
                transaction. This custom interface is needed (instead of using
                the generic Linux user-space PCI mapping) because the DDR bar
                is very small compared to the DDR memory and only the driver can
                move the bar before and after the transaction.
                If the IOMMU is disabled, it also allows the root user to read
                or write from the host a device VA of a host mapped memory

Description:    Allows the root user to disable/enable MAC loopback for Gaudi
                NIC ports. The ports will function as if a physical loopback
                transceiver was connected. A bitmask should be provided where
                each bit represents a port, up to 20 bits.
                Known issues for this mode:
                1. Odd ports PHY is not stopped so the peer's odd ports will get
                PCS link.
                2. Might cause an interrupt storm due to high B/W.
